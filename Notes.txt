Middleware in Express:

Middleware is a piece of code that executes between request to response 

Request made goes to middleware and sits in middleware until response is sent 

.use method is used as a middleware

In order to access files such as a CSS file you need to make use of a middleware to do so in Express 

we use express.static -> meaning the file become available for everyone to use 


mongodb password: 9QouLC6XJu2KKleH


while using mongodb if you want to post a data you use an instance of your Model (find it in the code for better understanding)

when just fetching data, you can use the method of your Model class directly 


 /// Manually Save Data in your DB 

//  app.get('/create-blog', (req,res)=>
//  {
//   const saveToDB = new Blog(
//     {
//       title:"Title",
//       snippets : "Empty", 
//       body: "This is some random dummy Text"
//     }
//   );
//   saveToDB.save().then((result)=>{
//     res.send(result);
//   }).catch((err) => {
//      console.log(err);
//   });

//  })
