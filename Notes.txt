Middleware in Express:

Middleware is a piece of code that executes between request to response 

Request made goes to middleware and sits in middleware until response is sent 

.use method is used as a middleware

In order to access files such as a CSS file you need to make use of a middleware to do so in Express 

we use express.static -> meaning the file become available for everyone to use

while using mongodb if you want to post a data you use an instance of your Model (find it in the code for better understanding)

when just fetching data, you can use the method of your Model class directly 


 /// Manually Save Data in your DB 

//  app.get('/create-blog', (req,res)=>
//  {
//   const saveToDB = new Blog(
//     {
//       title:"Title",
//       snippets : "Empty", 
//       body: "This is some random dummy Text"
//     }
//   );
//   saveToDB.save().then((result)=>{
//     res.send(result);
//   }).catch((err) => {
//      console.log(err);
//   });

//  })


for making posts request we require a middleware


/// Using Middleware

// use next to move forward but do not send res back
// app.use((req,res,next) =>
// {
//      console.log("Entered Middleware");
//      console.log("Method: ", req.method);
//      next();
// })


Creating Detail page lohic: 

you create a url through ejs page 

then create a get request for that URL and get the daataaa


/// For controllers we just made arrow functions and copy pasted the logic of get post in them 

we then later called those function in our routes which works as routers for navigating 
to pages and doing requests 

which was later called as a middleware in the server js class 


AND THAT WRAPS IT UP!!!!
