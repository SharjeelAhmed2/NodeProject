Middleware in Express:

Middleware is a piece of code that executes between request to response 

Request made goes to middleware and sits in middleware until response is sent 

.use method is used as a middleware

In order to access files such as a CSS file you need to make use of a middleware to do so in Express 

we use express.static -> meaning the file become available for everyone to use
